## Overview

Minimum setup for writing Unikernels in ReasonML.

## Note to anyone who happens to find this repository

I have confirmed that you can build on macOS, but I don't think you can probably
build on another operating system without extra works. This is a repository I
created to explain to my friends who use macOS and I don't plan to provide much
support. If you are a user of another operating system, you probably need to
manually rewrite the dune config file. But, Mirage will support Dune, so you
probably won't need these extra works in the future. And the code was stolen
from Tim Dysinger's [restack](https://github.com/dysinger/restack) repository.

## Build instructions
